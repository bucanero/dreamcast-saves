ALIENFIGHTER
---------------------------------------------------------------------
An excellent vertical shoot em up with a very good realisation. Various sound effects, very smooth scrolling, perfect control, menus are clear with numerous settings, number of sprites on the screen and backgrounds are really impressive for a VM game. Plus it's hard and interesting enough to make you busy for a while!
